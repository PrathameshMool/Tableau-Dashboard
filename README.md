Hello I have been learning Tableau to as it is a necessary software environment to analyse data and prepare beautiful dashboards for presentation and Displaying tp the clients.

I have Analysed a financial complaints Data set and prepared a engaging Dashboard using Tableau

The goal of this project was to create a financial complaints dashboard using Tableau to visually represent the volume and types of complaints received by a financial institution. The dashboard was designed to provide a high-level overview of the complaints received, as well as allow users to drill down into specific data points and explore trends in more detail.

The dashboard included a variety of charts and graphs, such as bar charts, pie charts, and maps, to represent data in an easy-to-understand format. It also included interactive features, such as filters and parameters, to allow users to customize the data displayed on the dashboard and focus on specific areas of interest.
