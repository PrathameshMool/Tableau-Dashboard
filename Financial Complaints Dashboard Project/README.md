# Financial Complaints analysis project description

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



The goal of this project was to create a financial complaints dashboard using Tableau to visually represent the volume and types of complaints received by a financial institution. The dashboard was designed to provide a high-level overview of the complaints received, as well as allow users to drill down into specific data points and explore trends in more detail.

The dashboard included a variety of charts and graphs, such as bar charts, pie charts, and maps, to represent data in an easy-to-understand format. It also included interactive features, such as filters and parameters, to allow users to customize the data displayed on the dashboard and focus on specific areas of interest.

The data was cleaned and prepped for analysis using a combination of Excel and Tableau's data preparation tools.

Overall, the financial complaints dashboard provides a valuable resource for the financial institution to monitor and track the volume and types of complaints received, as well as identify trends and areas for improvement. It also provides a transparent view of the institution's customer service and complaint resolution processes for external stakeholders, such as regulators and customers.
